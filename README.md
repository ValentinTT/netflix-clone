# Netflix clone

This is a simple clone of the Netflix's browser page. In the future an implementation it might have a login page.

Initially it will only be front-end, there will not be backend, and the images will all come from the public folder.

### Stack
I will use React + Typescript, and styled components for the styling.


### Components
The page will have the following components:

+ Navbar
+ Front image / video
+ carrousel with movies/series
+ infinite scroll
+ more info about the movie (only a modal)
